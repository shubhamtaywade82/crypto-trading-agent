 * Does entry timing beat a coin flip? For a driftless price path, a bracket with planned reward:risk `rr` hits its
 * target before its stop with probability 1 / (1 + rr) whatever the entry. Comparing the observed number of target
 * hits with that expectation tests the *entry signal* alone, before costs. Only trades that ended at their own target
 * or stop are counted (trailing/manual closes have no clean bracket outcome).
 *
 * Caveats: real paths have drift (a long-only strategy in an uptrend beats 1/(1+rr) without any skill), the normal
 * approximation is rough at small n, and a hit rate above chance is necessary for, not proof of, positive expectancy
 * after costs.
