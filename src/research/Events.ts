/**
 * Research-plane event sourcing — adapted from agent-tui's `supervisor/state/events.ts` pattern.
 *
 * Every meaningful state transition in the research plane emits a domain event. The event bus is an
 * in-process pub/sub; subscribers persist to `data/research-events.jsonl` (the canonical audit trail),
 * stream to a future dashboard, or feed the metrics collector. The bus is the only thing the
 * ChampionRegistry, ExperimentStore, and SelfImprovementLoop need to notify — they don't write to
 * the audit log directly anymore.
 *
 * Why event sourcing here:
 *   - The current ChampionRegistry.history array is a flat list of `{at, from, to, kind, note}` records
 *     with no payload detail. A real audit trail needs the experiment id, the verdict, the policy
 *     that was applied — that's exactly what the domain events carry.
 *   - Replay: a corrupted champion-registry.json can be reconstructed by replaying research-events.jsonl.
 *   - Streaming: a future dashboard subscribes to the bus and re-renders on every transition.
 *
 * The event types are discriminated by `type` so a switch is exhaustive. Adding a new event type is
 * a breaking change to consumers — bump the version on `ResearchEventSchema` and update subscribers.
