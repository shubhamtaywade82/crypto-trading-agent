# crypto-trading-agent

A TypeScript agent for Binance USD-M perpetual futures. Multi-strategy signal
generation, risk gating, an optional Ollama LLM veto layer, and a TUI cockpit
built on Ink. Routes orders to either a local in-memory paper engine, a remote
`paper_exchange` Rails broker (over HTTP), or live Binance.

---

## Modes

| `MODE` | Backend | SL/TP/trailing exits | Per-strategy attribution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `paper` (default, no `PAPER_EXCHANGE_URL`) | Local in-memory `PaperEngine` | Agent-side, checked on every price tick | Yes (positions keyed by `symbol+strategy`) |
| `paper` + `PAPER_EXCHANGE_URL` | Remote `paper_exchange` Rails broker via `RemoteBroker` | Agent-side reduce-only market orders (the broker never evaluates resting orders and has no price feed). Liquidation, fees and funding are exchange-side | Yes: one account, a symbol is owned by the strategy that opened it |
| `live` | Live Binance | Exchange-side STOP_MARKET / TAKE_PROFIT_MARKET | No — Binance positions are per-symbol |

**A CoinDCX live-execution migration is in progress but not live yet.** `src/coindcx/coindcxClient.ts`
already implements a full `ExchangeApi` adapter for CoinDCX, but it is not wired into `BinanceService` —
`MODE=live` still executes exclusively through `BinanceService.submitLiveOrder()` (raw Binance) exactly as
the table above describes, and only needs `BINANCE_API_KEY`/`BINANCE_API_SECRET` to start. An earlier commit
added a startup check requiring `COINDCX_API_KEY`/`COINDCX_API_SECRET` for `MODE=live` even though nothing
used them yet; that check has been removed (see issue #31) until the wiring
(`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-22-coindcx-live-execution.md`, Task 5) actually lands — finishing it needs
the private `@nemesis-oss/coindcx-sdk` package (a `file:` dependency never added to `package.json`), which
isn't published anywhere a CI runner or a fresh clone can install it from.

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhamtaywade82/crypto-trading-agent.git
cd crypto-trading-agent
cp .env.example .env   # then edit .env for your risk limits
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

The cockpit needs at least 160×53 terminal cells (`MIN_COLS` x `MIN_ROWS` in `src/ui/panels.tsx`). Use `?` inside the cockpit
for the command cheatsheet.

---

## Backtesting

```bash
npx tsx scripts/backtest.ts --symbol BTCUSDT --days 30 --funding
```

Fetches public Binance USD-M klines and replays the **same** strategy agents, regime routing, signal fusion,
risk gate and execution-quality gate the orchestrator runs each cycle — only the market and execution adapters
differ. The replay is strict about causality: decisions taken at a bar close see only candles that had closed by
then, and fill at the next bar's open with half-spread, slippage and taker fees; intrabar exits resolve
stop-before-target (conservative), and stops that gap through the open fill at the open. Funding payments
settle on their boundaries when `--funding` is passed.

The report covers expectancy, profit factor, Sharpe/Sortino, CVaR, MAE/MFE, fees/funding/slippage and
research slices by strategy, regime, symbol and evidence bucket (does a high setup grade actually earn
more?). Pass `--decisions data/backtest-decisions.jsonl` to keep the decision journal produced by the run —
every decision carries the evidence it was taken on and, once closed, its realized outcome.

The replay also runs the **learning loop** the orchestrator runs each cycle: closed trades grade into the
per-agent stats of an in-memory agent ledger, and collected signals are confidence-adjusted from those
stats exactly like the live `collectSignals` path. The ledger is never written to disk, so one replay never
trains another (or the live bot); set `learning: false` in the replay config to A/B against the pre-learning
behaviour. The run's final per-agent stats (trades graded, wins, total R) come back on
`ReplayResult.agentStats`.

### Parameter sweeps

```bash
npm run sweep:struct-liq -- --symbols BTCUSDT,ETHUSDT --days 45
```

A parameter-sensitivity harness for the STRUCT-LIQ setup (`src/backtesting/StructLiqSweep.ts`): it
rebuilds the MarketState history with the same no-lookahead discipline as the replay engine and evaluates
the setup over a grid of `maxSweepAgeCandles` x `minimumRewardRisk` values, reporting distinct setups
(what cooldowns would turn into trades), emissions, and each cell's delta versus the default thresholds.
Pass `--fleet 6:1.5,24:1.0` to also run full fleet replays at chosen combos and see which fires survive
routing, fusion, risk and execution. A 45-day BTC+ETH sweep answered the firing-rate question directly:
the sweep-age window showed **zero** sensitivity (6 -> 96 candles admitted no new setups at any RR level)
while the reward-risk floor is the binding constraint (1.5 -> 1.0 doubles, -> 0.8 triples the setups;
removing it entirely admits 12x — the diagnostic ceiling of every other gate combined).

See `src/backtesting/` and `tests/replayService.test.ts` for the engine itself.

---

## Decision lineage

Every gated signal leaves a `DecisionRecord` in an append-only JSONL journal (`DECISIONS_PATH`, default
`data/decisions.jsonl`): the market state it saw, the deterministic evidence rubric and the composite score,
planned levels, the risk verdict, execution friction, and the realized outcome once the position closes. The
record is written in the same shape by the paper, live and replay paths (`src/decision/CandidateFlow.ts`),
and closed trades resolve back to their decision through the `decisionId` carried by the venue. The trade
grader scores against this stored evidence instead of a neutral placeholder, so "which conditions produced
profitable decisions?" becomes an empirical question:

```
cat data/decisions.jsonl | jq 'select(.outcome != null) | {score: .evidence.score, r: .outcome.rMultiple}'
```

---

## Risk state that survives restarts

The drawdown kill-switch measures against a persisted, mode-keyed equity high-water mark
(`data/risk-hwm.json`, atomic writes): a process crash mid-drawdown no longer resets the peak and silently
re-arms the bot. The same peak seeds the circuit-breaker's `PerformanceEngine`, so both drawdown views read
one authority.

---

## Position manager & market safety

**Market safety (entries only).** Every cycle each symbol gets a verdict (`src/market/MarketSafety.ts`):
`NORMAL`, `NO_ENTRY` or `HALT`. `RiskAgent.gate` rejects `OPEN_*` signals unless the symbol is `NORMAL` (reason
`safety <level>: …`, journaled like any rejection). Rules: mark missing/invalid or exchange status not `TRADING` → HALT;
websocket silent > `SAFETY_TICK_STALE_MS` → NO_ENTRY (HALT if the REST mark is stale too); stale 15m candle or derivatives
→ NO_ENTRY; **shock** → NO_ENTRY. Shock (`src/market/ShockDetector.ts`) is a 1m return z-score ≥ `SHOCK_RETURN_Z` confirmed
by a volume z-score or a spread blow-out, left only after `SHOCK_RECOVERY_BARS` calm bars. The gate never closes anything:
a protected position keeps its stop and its manager through a bad feed. Replay has no tick feed, so the gate does not apply there.

**Position manager (paper and remote paper_exchange).** `src/position/PositionManager.ts` is a pure state machine
(`INITIAL → PROTECTED → TRAILING`) driven by every price tick (250 ms) through `PositionDriver`, with ATR/structure inputs
cached per 8 s cycle. The entry strategy still owns the initial stop; the manager only ratchets it toward price.

| Step | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| TP1 | at +`PM_TP1_R` close `PM_TP1_FRACTION` of the entry quantity, arm breakeven at `entry ± entry × 2(fee+slippage)` |
| TP2 (RUNNER) | at +`PM_TP2_R` close `PM_TP2_FRACTION`, drop the fixed target (`serverTp = 'trail'`) |
| Trail | `max(extreme − k·ATR, protected 15m swing ∓ 0.15 ATR, SuperTrend)`, k = 2 / 2.5 / 3.2 by volatility class, never closer than 0.25 ATR to the mark, ratchet only |
| TARGET mode | the signal target stays the final exit (mean reversion always; any signal with TP ≤ 2R) |

A partial below the exchange lot/notional minimum, or one that would leave a remainder below it, is skipped (logged);
a failed or refused partial is retried on the next tick; through a `paper_exchange` outage a partial stays queued under one
client order id. State is persisted in `data/position-manager.json`; a position that changed outside the manager
(scale-in, restart) is rebuilt from the venue (a stop already at/over entry rebuilds as `PROTECTED` with TP1 taken).
**Live mode is unchanged** (exchange-side STOP_MARKET/TAKE_PROFIT_MARKET); the only live change is that `updateStops` now
re-places the take-profit it used to drop.

Partial legs are journaled as `PARTIAL TP` with `partial: true`. Everything that counts *positions* folds them into their
final close (`src/position/foldPartials.ts`): the learning ledger and confidence adjuster grade one blended R per position,
loss/win streaks and expectancy count positions, replay metrics report one trade per position (`result.partials` holds
the legs). Realized PnL sums, daily loss and drawdown still use every leg on its own day.

**Adaptive size.** The risk budget is `equity × RISK_PER_TRADE_PCT × circuit × volatility × score`; both new factors only
shrink it (ATR percentile ≥ 60/80/95 → ×0.75/0.5/0.25; evidence score < 75/65 → ×0.75/0.5). The stop distance still sets
the quantity, so leverage never sets the risk. A `portfolio_risk` check additionally caps the summed loss-at-stop of all open
positions plus the new trade at `MAX_PORTFOLIO_RISK_PCT` of equity (a stop at/over breakeven counts 0).

**Backtesting the manager.** `npx tsx scripts/backtest.ts --symbol BTCUSDT --days 30 --position-manager off|on` A/B-tests it.
The bar is walked adverse-extreme first (open → low → high → close for a long): stop/liquidation, then partials and stop
moves at the favourable extreme, then the remaining target, and a stop moved on a bar is tested against that bar's close — so a
stop move never helps a trade on the bar that produced it. Partials fill at their level (at the open on a gap); manager
inputs are the features of the last *closed* bar.

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables (validated with `zod` in
`src/config.ts`). The defaults shown below are the schema defaults, NOT
necessarily what's in `.env.example` — they were inconsistent before issue #9
was fixed.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MODE` | `paper` | `paper` or `live` |
| `BINANCE_API_KEY` / `BINANCE_API_SECRET` | (empty) | Required for `MODE=live` (market data always, and today's only order execution path) |
| `COINDCX_API_KEY` / `COINDCX_API_SECRET` / `COINDCX_PAPER_MODE` / `COINDCX_QUOTE_PREFERENCE` / `COINDCX_MAX_ORDER_NOTIONAL` / `COINDCX_MAX_ORDER_QUANTITY` / `COINDCX_INITIAL_BALANCE` | see `.env.example` | Optional, reserved for the CoinDCX execution path (see "Modes" above and issue #31); not required to start `MODE=live`, and currently unused even when set |
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | `http://127.0.0.1:11434` | Ollama daemon URL |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | `gemma4:31b` | Model used for veto/advise/ask |
| `MIN_LEVERAGE` | `5` | Floor for the dynamic-leverage calculation |
| `MAX_LEVERAGE` | `10` | Ceiling for the dynamic-leverage calculation |
| `MAX_EXPOSURE_PCT` | `80` | Cap on notional as a % of equity |
| `RISK_PER_TRADE_PCT` | `1` | Risk budget per trade as a % of equity |
| `POSITION_MANAGER` | `on` | Partials + breakeven + adaptive trail (paper / remote paper only), see [Position manager](#position-manager--market-safety) |
| `MAX_PORTFOLIO_RISK_PCT` | `3` | Cap on summed loss-at-stop of open positions + the new trade, % of equity |
| `SAFETY` | `on` | Market-safety / shock gate on new entries |
| `MAX_DRAWDOWN_PCT` | `5` | **Kill-switch** (issue #10): once drawdown from session peak exceeds this, all OPEN signals are rejected until recovery |
| `MIN_LIQ_BUFFER_ATR` | `2` | Minimum SL distance as a multiple of ATR(14) |
| `SYMBOLS` | `BTCUSDT,ETHUSDT,SOLUSDT,AVAXUSDT` | Universe |
| `STRUCT_LIQ` | `on` | `off` removes the STRUCT-LIQ-η agent from the fleet (shown paused in the cockpit) |
| `STRUCT_LIQ_MAX_SWEEP_AGE_CANDLES` | `6` | How old (15m candles) the STRUCT-LIQ trigger sweep may be |
| `STRUCT_LIQ_MIN_REWARD_RISK` | `1.5` | Minimum reward:risk the STRUCT-LIQ target liquidity must offer |
| `AUDIT` / `ALERTS` | `off` | Audit trail and Telegram alerts, see [Ops](#ops-audit-trail-telegram-alerts-kill-switch) |
| `PAPER_EXCHANGE_URL` | (unset) | When set in `paper` mode, routes through the remote Rails broker (`http://127.0.0.1:3100`) |
| `PAPER_EXCHANGE_ACCOUNT_ID` | (none) | Account for the remote broker; **required** when `PAPER_EXCHANGE_URL` is set in `paper` mode (startup fails without it); `.env.example` suggests `crypto-agent` |

---

## Paper trading on paper_exchange

Set `PAPER_EXCHANGE_URL` (and `PAPER_EXCHANGE_ACCOUNT_ID`) with `MODE=paper` and the agent trades on the
`paper_exchange` Rails broker instead of the local engine.

**Start the exchange:** `docker compose up -d` in `/home/nemesis/projects/apps/paper_exchange`
(health check: `GET http://127.0.0.1:3100/up`).

**Who holds what.** The exchange holds the wallet, positions, fees, funding and liquidations. The agent holds
strategy state and shows the exchange's numbers: equity is `available_balance + locked_margin + unrealized`
(re-marked from live ticks), so fees and funding are inside it. Journal PnL per trade is gross; fees and funding
show up in equity only.

**Account.** One shared account (`PAPER_EXCHANGE_ACCOUNT_ID`). On startup the agent creates it with 100 000
margin only if it does not exist; it never resets an existing account.

**Ownership rule.** Positions net per symbol. A symbol is owned by the strategy that opened it: other
strategies are refused before any order is sent. The owner may scale in (same side) or flip (full reduce-only
close journaled `FLIP`, then a new position). A position on the exchange with no sidecar entry (manual trade,
lost sidecar) is adopted as `EXECUTOR-ε`, without SL/TP, and strategies never touch it.

**Exits are agent-side.** SL, TP and trailing stops are evaluated against the agent's own price ticks; a breach
sends a reduce-only market order for the exact quantity, one exit in flight per symbol. If the agent is offline
nothing exits (the broker has no price feed); liquidation is the only server-side exit.

**Sidecar `data/remote-state.json`.** Holds owner, SL/TP and initial risk per position, plus the closed-trade
journal (last 1000). The file is bound to one account id. After resetting the exchange account, delete it.

**Outage behavior.** While the exchange is down, entries are refused (`VenueUnavailableError`) and nothing is
sent. Exits queue and retry (about once a second) under one client order id, and complete after recovery, at the
worse of the trigger and the current mark for stops. The loop and cockpit keep running on cached data: the
footer shows `venue paper_exchange (<account>) ●connected|degraded|down` and the equity line shows `stale`
when down.

**End-to-end check.** `npm run e2e:paper-exchange` runs scenarios S1–S24 (design spec:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-21-paper-exchange-end-to-end-design.md`) through `RemoteBroker` and prints one
PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED line per scenario with the agent and exchange numbers it compared; non-zero exit on any failure.

- `E2E_BACKEND=fake` (default): in-memory exchange replica, no network.
- `E2E_BACKEND=real`: needs `PAPER_EXCHANGE_URL`; creates a throwaway account `e2e-<epoch>` (the run refuses any
  other account id) and trades only synthetic symbols `E2EAUSDT`, `E2EBUSDT`, ... because the exchange's mark
  prices and liquidation scan are shared across accounts. Scenarios that need a controlled outage or a lost
  response (S14, S15) are `SKIPPED (fake-only)`; S13 runs against a closed port. The exchange cannot delete
  accounts, so `e2e-*` accounts stay in its database.

---

## Ops: audit trail, Telegram alerts, kill-switch

Both are on by default and isolated from trading: an audit, alert or Telegram failure is swallowed before it
reaches the loop, and sends are fire-and-forget, so trading never waits on Telegram. With a flag turned off its
hook does nothing: no file is written, no request is made, no timer is started. `ALERTS=on` still needs
`TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` and a bot token below before it can actually send anything — until those are set it has nothing
to send to.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AUDIT` | `on` | `off` stops appending a JSON line per decision step to `EVENTS_PATH` |
| `ALERTS` | `on` | `off` stops sending Telegram cards (and the daily digest timer) |
| `EVENTS_PATH` | `data/events.jsonl` | Audit trail; rotated to `<file>.1` at 5 MB |
| `NOTIFICATIONS_PATH` | `data/notifications.json` | Optional subscription JSON (missing or invalid means every class on) |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | (unset) | Destination chat, required to send |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | (unset) | Shared bot, used when a channel has no bot of its own |
| `TELEGRAM_TRADING_BOT_TOKEN` | (unset) | Bot for TRADE and SIGNAL cards |
| `TELEGRAM_ALERTBOT_BOT_TOKEN` | (unset) | Bot for SYSTEM and digest cards |
| `TELEGRAM_DRY_RUN` | (unset) | `1` writes each card to the cockpit log (`[telegram dry-run] ...`) instead of sending; works without tokens |

**Enable it:** both are already on; add `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` plus a bot token (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, or the two
per-channel tokens) to `.env` to let `ALERTS` actually send. Try it first with `TELEGRAM_DRY_RUN=1`. Tokens are
never logged. The audit trail and the alerts are independent of `RISK_ENGINE`. Set `AUDIT=off` / `ALERTS=off` to
disable either.

**Audit trail.** Each signal keeps one `decisionId` (the signal's `id`) from `signal` through `gate`, `veto`,
`order`, `exit` and `journal`; refusals are `refusal` events with the same id. System events (`venue`, `circuit`,
`crash`, `killswitch`, `digest`) carry none. Exits are detected from the closed-trade journal, so a stop, a
liquidation or an off-agent close is reported even when the loop logged nothing. A position opened before a restart
has no `decisionId` on its exit.

**What each alert covers** (a card is audible unless its severity is below IMPORTANT):

| Class | Cards | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TRADE (trading bot) | position opened, scale-in, flip; exit with reason, gross PnL and R (R needs the position's initial stop) | fill: SIGNAL; exit: IMPORTANT; liquidation: CRITICAL |
| SIGNAL (trading bot) | entry accepted; entry refused (risk gate or executor); entry vetoed by the advisor | accepted: SIGNAL; refused/vetoed: WATCH (silent) |
| SETUP (trading bot) | deterministic multi-scenario flow map: regime, structure, liquidity, crowding, entry zones, SL/TP, trigger, invalidation, flow hypothesis and expected move window | triggered: SIGNAL; developing: WATCH (silent) |
| SYSTEM (alert bot) | venue degraded / down / recovered, websocket drop after it was up, loop crash, circuit-breaker change, kill-switch on/off | down, crash, HALTED/EMERGENCY, kill-switch: CRITICAL; others IMPORTANT (websocket reconnecting: WATCH) |
| RESEARCH (alert bot) | daily digest at 00:05 UTC for the previous UTC day: PnL, trades, win rate, profit factor, best/worst, drawdown, refusals by reason, per-strategy results (gross realized PnL; a dash where a ratio is undefined) | WATCH (silent) |

### Institutional-style setup maps

The alert pipeline can also publish one deterministic `SETUP` map per symbol instead of relying only on entry/refusal cards. A setup map summarizes the current directional regime, HTF/LTF structure, liquidity, crowding and derivatives context, then presents up to three executable hypotheses (liquidity sweep, pullback/retest, breakout/retest) with entry zone, invalidation, stop, targets, reward/risk, trigger, flow hypothesis, expected move window and thesis expiry.

These are **market-derived hypotheses**, not claims of privileged institutional intent. The flow field explicitly describes an inference from observable positioning/aggression/liquidity data. Expected move windows are currently deterministic volatility/ATR model estimates; they are not yet historical time-to-target quantiles. The setup engine never routes an order by itself: the existing risk gate, execution-quality checks and executor remain authoritative.

Setup maps are generated from the same `MarketState` already built by `Orchestrator.gatherContext()`. `WATCHING` cards use WATCH severity; `TRIGGERED` cards use SIGNAL severity. Setup alerts are deduplicated with a 15-minute cooldown, while a WATCHING → TRIGGERED transition is emitted immediately. Configure them through the existing `SETUP` class in `NOTIFICATIONS_PATH`; no new Telegram credentials are required.

### Multi-persona agentic AI and self-learning

`LLM_COUNCIL` is on by default: the runtime runs a research council above the deterministic market engine. Five specialist personas (technical, liquidity, derivatives, regime and skeptic) analyze the same normalized `MarketState` and setup map independently, then a portfolio-chair persona synthesizes the reports and may select only a supplied setup scenario or `WATCH`/`NO_TRADE`. Set `LLM_COUNCIL=off` to disable it entirely (no persona calls, no learning-ledger predictions).

The council never creates price levels, sizes positions or bypasses `RiskAgent`, execution-quality checks or `ExecutorAgent`. LLM output is schema-validated. Each persona can use a different Ollama model through the `OLLAMA_*_MODEL` variables; all default to `OLLAMA_MODEL`.

`LLM_COUNCIL_AUTOTRADE` is also on by default (requires `LLM_COUNCIL=on`): a chair `TRADE` verdict is converted into a real `Signal` — but only when it targets a setup scenario the deterministic `SetupEngine` has *itself* already confirmed `TRIGGERED`, and only above `LLM_COUNCIL_MIN_PROBABILITY` (default 0.65). The signal's entry, stop loss and take-profit are always the scenario's own deterministic values; the LLM selects a scenario, it never invents a price. `WATCH`/`NO_TRADE` verdicts and verdicts on a `FORMING`/`ARMED` scenario are never traded. Because the council runs detached from the tick loop (to keep local-LLM latency off the trading loop), an approved verdict is queued and picked up by the risk gate on the next cycle, dropped after 5 minutes if unconsumed. From there it is one more `Signal` with agent id `AI-COUNCIL-κ`: it still goes through `RiskAgent.gate()` (mandatory stop loss, position sizing, drawdown kill-switch), execution-quality checks and the same Telegram/audit notices as every other agent's signal. Set `LLM_COUNCIL_AUTOTRADE=off` to keep the council advisory-only (it still runs and still logs every verdict) without touching `LLM_COUNCIL`.

The learning ledger is persistent and idempotent. Closed trades update per-agent realized-R statistics, with symbol-specific history preferred after enough observations. Closed-trade keys are persisted so restarting the process cannot train twice on the same trade. Persona and chair forecasts are also persisted as prediction episodes and resolved later against live marks at their stated horizons using an adaptive volatility threshold. Resolution records directional correctness and a Brier score for calibration. The replay engine runs the same per-agent stats loop against an in-memory ledger (never persisted), so backtests exercise — and report — the same learned confidence adjustment the live fleet would apply.

This is adaptive self-learning, not live fine-tuning of neural-network weights. The learned state influences deterministic signal-confidence adjustment and is fed back to persona prompts as historical memory. It does not mutate code or bypass the risk boundary automatically; candidate policy changes should still be validated through replay/backtesting before production.


Repeats are dropped by fingerprint: a refused signal for the same symbol, agent and reason at most once per 15
minutes, and the same system alert at most once per 5 minutes. Optional `NOTIFICATIONS_PATH` JSON turns classes,
symbols or a minimum severity off, for example `{"notifications": {"signal": false, "minSeverity": "IMPORTANT"}}`
(SYSTEM CRITICAL alerts are never suppressed).

**Kill-switch.** Press `k` in the cockpit to halt new entries: every OPEN is refused with `kill-switch: manual`,
whatever `RISK_ENGINE` says, and the risk row of the fleet panel shows `KILL-SWITCH`. Exits, stops and manual closes
are never affected. Press `k` again to resume. The state is saved to `data/kill-switch.json`, so a restart does not
resume trading by itself (press `k` or delete the file to clear it). A circuit-breaker HALTED/EMERGENCY (`RISK_ENGINE`,
on by default) refuses entries on its own and is announced as a SYSTEM alert; it does not touch the kill-switch.
Set `RISK_ENGINE=off` to fall back to the legacy sizing path (no fee netting, exposure caps or circuit breaker).

With `MODE=live` (without `PAPER_EXCHANGE_URL`) the venue keeps no per-strategy trade journal, so the risk engine cannot see realized losses there: the daily-loss and loss-streak limits stay inactive (only drawdown applies) and a warning is logged at start.

### STRUCT-LIQ and the liquidity ledger

`agents/StructureLiquidityAgent.ts` runs `decision/StructureLiquidityStrategy.ts` — the SMC trend
setup: HTF directional regime -> LTF liquidity sweep -> LTF BOS/CHOCH confirmation -> opposing
liquidity target. It is a first-class fleet member (paper, live and replay all run the same
agent, one evaluation per closed 15m candle per symbol) and the first consumer of the
market-state hardening ledgers:

- **Trigger sweeps** are drawn from the persistent `sweepHistory` (causally replayed over the
  whole window) unioned with the legacy 12-bar window. Sweeps of pools that aged out of the
  per-snapshot pool list still qualify, and a sweep must predate the confirming break — the
  strategy enforces causality rather than assuming it.
- **Take-profit targets** skip every pool the sweep ledger marked `taken`. Spent liquidity is
  never re-targeted: the setup walks out to the nearest untaken pool or stands down.
- **Stops** anchor on a zone that is alive per the zone ledger — FRESH, or TESTED (preferred:
  it already absorbed one retest), formed before the break. When the ledger says every zone is
  dead (MITIGATED/INVALIDATED/EXPIRED), the stop rides the sweep price alone instead of leaning
  on a zone the ledger has retired.

These are behavioral changes against the pre-ledger strategy: some setups that were missed now
fire, setups that aimed at already-consumed liquidity now aim further out or do not fire, and
stops no longer trust legacy "fresh" zones the ledger knows are spent. States without ledger
annotations (and `RANGE_*` pools, which the ledger does not mark) fall back to the exact legacy
behavior. The strategy stays deterministic and analysis-only — the router (directional regimes
only), signal fusion (it competes with the other market-state strategies per symbol), the risk
gate and the executor remain authoritative. Set `STRUCT_LIQ=off` to remove the agent from the
fleet; the cockpit then shows it paused.

Two thresholds are env-tunable without code changes — `STRUCT_LIQ_MAX_SWEEP_AGE_CANDLES` (default 6)
and `STRUCT_LIQ_MIN_REWARD_RISK` (default 1.5) — wired identically into the live fleet and the replay
fleet. The parameter sweep above measured their sensitivity on real data: the age window is not the
binding gate (the trigger sweep is fresh whenever the other gates pass), while the RR floor is — lower
it to admit thinner targets at a known cost in expectancy per trade. The startup log names the active
tuning whenever it deviates from the defaults.

## Known gaps (cross-referenced to GitHub issues)

Issues #1–#7, #10, #11 and #12 are closed as fixed (verified against current source, see each entry
below); #9 is resolved (`.env.example` and `config.ts` no longer disagree); #31 is fixed on an interim
basis (see its entry below and the "Modes" section above).

### #1 — SL/TP in remote-paper mode

**Superseded.** Server-side stop orders are gone: the broker never re-evaluates resting orders and has no price
feed. Exits are agent-side reduce-only market orders (see "Paper trading on paper_exchange"), so nothing exits
while the agent is offline.

### #2 — Funding not wired into run loop

**Fixed.** `RemoteBroker.observeFunding` detects when Binance's `nextFundingTime` jumps forward (the next
boundary moves by 8h) and pushes one funding event per symbol with the boundary timestamp. The broker dedupes on
`(paper_position_id, funding_time)`. A failed push is logged and not retried.

### #3 — Per-strategy attribution lost in remote/live

**Fixed for remote paper** by the ownership rule (a symbol belongs to the strategy that opened it; the sidecar
records it). Live Binance positions are still per-symbol.

### #4 — AdaptiveSuperTrendAgent disabled in remote-paper/live

**Fixed for remote paper.** Its stop updates are persisted in the sidecar only for positions it owns. It stays
disabled in live mode (`Orchestrator.start()` logs why).

### #5 — Paper engine 250ms debounce can drop last state on crash

**Fixed.** `PaperEngine.flushSync()` writes the state synchronously, and
`Orchestrator.flushOnShutdown()` is wired to SIGINT/SIGTERM in `App.tsx`.

### #6 — Ollama advisor was fail-open on parse errors

**Fixed.** `parseVerdict` now returns `VETO` on unparseable replies and on
unknown verdict strings — fail-closed for hard errors. Offline and network
errors still fail-open (PROCEED) because deterministic code owns the entry
decision; the veto is a belt-and-braces check.

### #7 — paperExchangeClient threw on non-204 with no retry

**Fixed.** 5xx errors and network errors retry up to 2 times with exponential
backoff (250ms, 500ms) and end as `VenueUnavailableError`. 4xx errors surface
immediately as `OrderRejectedError` (retrying a client error is wrong).

### #10 — MAX_DRAWDOWN_PCT was display-only

**Fixed.** `RiskAgent.isDrawdownBreached` tracks session-peak equity and
rejects all OPEN signals once drawdown exceeds the limit. Closes
(reduceOnly + opposite-side exits) still pass — reducing exposure is the
correct response to a drawdown breach.

### #11 — PairsAgent disabled

**Fixed (deleted).** The agent, its `PAIRS-TRD-β` `AgentId` and its permanently-paused fleet row are
removed — it only ever signaled a BTC/ETH close-ratio, which is not a tradable exchange symbol. The
underlying BTC/ETH divergence z-score is still shown in the cockpit as an informational-only metric
(the "DIVERGENCE" row in `renderMetricsLines`), decoupled from any trading strategy.

### #12 — getTrades() returns [] in remote-paper mode

**Fixed.** The trade journal lives in the sidecar (`data/remote-state.json`); the agent computes its own
statistics from it instead of the exchange's `/api/performance`.

### #31 — MODE=live required CoinDCX credentials it never used

**Fixed (interim).** The fail-closed check requiring `COINDCX_API_KEY`/`COINDCX_API_SECRET` for `MODE=live`
has been removed — see "Modes" above. `MODE=live` needs only Binance credentials again until the CoinDCX
wiring (Task 5 of `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-22-coindcx-live-execution.md`) actually lands, which needs
the private `@nemesis-oss/coindcx-sdk` package this environment cannot install.
